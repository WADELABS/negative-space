# Design Decisions: Negative Space

### Objective: Epistemology & Knowledge Engineering

- **Decision 1: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**: We treat missing knowledge as a primary data structure to mitigate LLM hallucinations in high-void sectors.
- **Decision 2: Monte Carlo Void Interpolation**: Selected for Layer 1 to estimate knowledge density across non-linear regulatory landscapes.
- **Decision 3: Boundary Mapping Logic**: Designed to augment human oversight by flagging high-uncertainty zones rather than automating them.
