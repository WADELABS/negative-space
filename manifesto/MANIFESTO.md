# Fixer's Log: Negative Space
## Solving the "Unknown Unknowns" Crisis (Phase 3)

> "A security research group reached out after a catastrophic breach that 'should have been impossible.' Their entire audit had focused on the components that existed. They had no way to map what was *missing*—the empty spaces where the attacker lived. They didn't need a better scanner; they needed a way to map the architectural void."

### The Epistemological "Why": Mapping the Seen to Navigate the Complex
In the architecture of autonomy, the voids define the system...

## 🧩 The Epistemological "Why"
Traditional engineering focuses on the assembly of known components. **Negative Space Reasoning** operates on the inverse: it defines the exact shape of missing dependencies, information gaps, and constraint barriers. By treating the "void" as a first-class object, we transform systemic uncertainty into a precisely mapped territory, allowing agentic systems to navigate complexity through exclusion and targeted inquiry.
