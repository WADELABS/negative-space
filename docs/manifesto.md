# The Manifesto of Negative Space

## 1. The Primacy of Doubt
In a world of stochastic parrots, certainty is a liability. We advocate for a "Doubt First" methodology where every claim is viewed through its missing context.

## 2. Defining the Gap
The "Negative Space" is the information that exists between established data points. A high-fidelity agent doesn't just connect the dots; it understands the void between them.

## 3. Epistemological Sovereignty
The goal of this substrate is to ensure that the AI remains the agent of its own knowledge, capable of admitting ignorance with higher precision than it declares fact.

## 4. Stability through Contradiction
We seek not to resolve contradictions, but to use them as anchors for reality. Where logic breaks, the truth usually hides.
