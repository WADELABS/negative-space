# Case File: Negative Space (Epistemological Substrate) 🌌

> **"My friend restores classic motorcycles. He'd bought a 1972 Triumph that came in three crates—engine here, frame there, a box of unlabeled parts that looked important. The manual was useless (wrong model year), the internet had conflicting advice, and every mechanic he called had a different opinion on what went where.**
>
> **He didn't need more opinions. He needed to build a map of what was missing before he could build the bike.**
>
> **So I built Negative Space.**
>
> **It's a reverse-engineering framework for working with incomplete information. You feed in what you have—parts, documentation fragments, known constraints—and Negative Space generates a structural map of what's absent. It doesn't guess what the missing pieces are. It shows you where gaps exist, what kinds of things probably fill them, and how to look for evidence of what belongs there.**
>
> **The Triumph's mystery box? Negative Space mapped the frame connections, cross-referenced against known engine configurations, and identified six possible bracket types that could attach the oil tank. Three were plausible given the bolt patterns. One matched wear marks on the frame.**
>
> **He ordered that bracket. It fit perfectly.**
>
> **Now he uses it for every project. A 1967 BMW with 'all original parts' but no wiring diagram? Negative Space mapped the electrical paths based on component locations and known grounding patterns. He found two missing relays before he even started buying wire.**
>
> **The framework didn't give him data he didn't have. It gave him a way to see the shape of what was missing—and that turned out to be enough."**

## 🏛️ FORENSIC SUMMARY: The Reverse-Engineering Pillar
Negative Space is a high-fidelity **Epistemological Substrate** designed for the study and quantification of "Computational Doubt." It moves beyond simple knowledge retrieval and into the rigorous mapping of the **Unknown** via black-box reverse engineering.

### 🧠 Core Substrate Pillars
1. **Ontological Mapping**: Identifying the boundaries of a model's knowledge graph.
2. **Doubt Heuristics**: Calculating the "Epistemological Uncertainty" (EU) of any given dataset or response.
3. **Mechanical & Electrical Inference**: Predicting the 'Negative Space' where physical or logical components *must* exist based on surrounding constraints.

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **`src/ontology.py`**: Mapping semantic density and connectivity.
- **`src/doubt.py`**: Heuristics for calculating doubt scores based on data sparsity and contradiction frequency.
- **`docs/manifesto.md`**: The foundational treaty on Computational Epistemology.

## 🚀 Phase 3 Role
Negative Space is the "Scout" for the ecosystem. It identifies the "Dark Matter" in datasets—the information that isn't there but should be—enabling safe, novel generative solutions.
