# Negative Space: Epistemological Substrate 🌌

> **"The map is not the territory, but the territory is defined by what the map omits."**

Negative Space is a high-fidelity **Epistemological Substrate** designed for the study and quantification of "Computational Doubt." It moves beyond simple knowledge retrieval and into the rigorous mapping of the **Unknown**.

## 🏛️ The Philosophy: Quantifying the Abyss
Negative Space focuses on the "Inference Gap"—the distance between what an AI model claims and what the underlying reality-stream supports. In the Wadelabs ecosystem, this project serves as the research engine that identifies where the "Scientific Method" needs to be applied most aggressively.

### 🧠 Core Substrate Pillars
1. **Ontological Mapping**: Identifying the boundaries of a model's knowledge graph.
2. **Doubt Heuristics**: Calculating the "Epistemological Uncertainty" (EU) of any given dataset or response.
3. **Inference Gap Detection**: Pinpointing the exact moment where logic becomes untethered from semantic grounding.

## ⚙️ Architecture
- **`src/ontology.py`**: Mapping semantic density and connectivity.
- **`src/doubt.py`**: Heuristics for calculating doubt scores based on data sparsity and contradiction frequency.
- **`docs/manifesto.md`**: The foundational treaty on Computational Epistemology.

## 🚀 Phase 3 Role
Negative Space is the "Scout" for the ecosystem. It identifies the "Dark Matter" in datasets—the information that isn't there but should be—enabling safe, novel generative solutions.
