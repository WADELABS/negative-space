## 🏛️ Grounding: The Problem of Knowledge Gaps
In complex systems, AI models often fail not because of what they know, but because they are unaware of what they *don't* know. This "Epistemic Void" leads to hallucinations, overconfidence, and catastrophic failures in high-stakes environments. Traditional AI systems are reactive to known errors but blind to "Hidden Voids".

**Negative Space solves this by treating "What is Missing" as a primary data structure—quantifying uncertainty as a first-class citizen.**

## 🌌 The Void Map
The core engine of Negative Space is **Uncertainty Quantification (UQ)**, which maps the system's knowledge boundaries to prevent AI overreach:

- **Void Interpolation**: Identifying gaps in the knowledge graph where the system lacks sufficient training data or logical grounding.
- **Risk Surface Mapping**: Visualizing the density of "missing knowledge" to determine if a decision should be handed off to a human supervisor.
- **Boundary Enforcement**: Preventing AI hallucinations by rigorously flagging any inference that falls within a high-density "Epistemic Void".

> **Production Case Study**: We use bio-hazard compliance mapping as our research environment—a domain where navigating a "Void" of regulatory and technical uncertainties is critical for global safety.

## 🚀 7-Layer Complexity Architecture

1.  **Probabilistic Void Interpolation**: (Layer 1) Uses **Monte Carlo** simulations to estimate the density of missing knowledge, providing a "Risk Surface" map.
2.  **Multispectral Mapping**: (Layer 2) Analysis across Technical, Regulatory, and Ethical spectrums to ensure no "Invisible Voids" persist.
3.  **Dynamic Barrier Collapse**: (Layer 3) A simulator that models the downstream impact of resolving a single knowledge gap.
4.  **Collective Epistemic Consensus**: (Layer 4) A multi-agent arbitration engine that resolves disagreements between specialized knowledge sub-systems.
5.  **Graph-based Void Topology**: (Layer 5) Using **NetworkX** to map the inter-dependency of gaps and identify "Bottleneck Gaps".
6.  **Temporal Void Drift**: (Layer 6) Real-time tracking of how "State Voids" evolve over time as new information is acquired or axioms expire.
7.  **Auto-Mitigation Harnesses**: (Layer 7) Automated generation of technical mocks or protocols to bridge identified voids and restore safety.

## 🛠️ Performance & Resilience
- **Predictive Closure**: Identifies the "First Domino" gaps that, when closed, resolve multiple downstream issues.
- **Topology-Aware**: Prioritizes bottlenecks over simple volume, optimizing resource allocation.
- **Epistemic Certainty**: Move from "We think we're safe" to "The void density is <0.05".
